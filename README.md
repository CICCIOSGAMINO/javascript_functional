Javascript Functional Programming 
=================================

### Intro 
Having said that, a nice image of a system built along functional principles is an
assembly-line device that takes raw materials in one end, and gradually builds a product
that comes out the other end. 

> All the Javascript are tested with Node.js (you can use the code in the Browser too).

### Why Functional 
As programs get bigger, they also become more complex and harder to understand. We all think
ourselves pretty clever, of course, but we are mere human beings, and even a moderate amount
of chaos tends to baffle us. And then it all goes downhill.

That JavaScript supports both models means that systems can and should be composed of both
models. Finding the balance between functional and object-oriented styles is a tricky task,
but javascripts good part is a lot inside the functional part. 

### OO Vs Functional 
In a system observing a strict object-oriented style, the interactions between objects
cause internal change to each object, leading to an overall system state that is the amal‐
gamation of many smaller, potentially subtle state changes. These interrelated state
changes form a conceptual “web of change” that, at times, can be confusing to keep in
your head. This confusion becomes a problem when the act of adding new objects and
system features requires a working knowledge of the subtleties of potentially far-
reaching state changes.

A functional system, on the other hand, strives to minimize observable state modifica‐
tion. Therefore, adding new features to a system built using functional principles is a
matter of understanding how new functions can operate within the context of localized,
nondestructive (i.e., original data is never changed) data transformations. However, I
hesitate to create a false dichotomy and say that functional and object-oriented styles
should stand in opposition.
